# Preface {.unnumbered}

This textbook is for medical students, doctors, medical researchers, nurses, members of professions allied to medicine, and all others concerned with medical data.

While statistics books focus on mathematics, this textbook focuses on using a computer to conduct data analysis. That means using a statistical software package, in this case the [Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) programming language for statistics and graphics. Our aim is to keep a balance between mathematical rigor and readability as well as learning R and statistics simultaneously.

Most of the examples discussed in this textbook are based on scientific studies whose data are publicly available. For each example, we provide the step-by-step application of R. Readers are encouraged to follow these steps while reading the textbook so that they can learn statistics through hands-on experience.

All sections of this textbook are reproducible as they were made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)^®^ that includes R code used to produce the figures, tables and results. Quarto^®^ is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
